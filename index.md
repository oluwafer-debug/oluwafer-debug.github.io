## 👋 Welcome

Hi! I am Oluwaferanmi Isola, a graduate of the University of Derby with an MSc in Big Data Analytics. I have worked in the fields of data science, analytics, and
 business intelligence, and I have developed predictive models, automated analytics workflows, and dashboards that have influenced learning, marketing, and
 financial decision-making in companies in the UK, Finland, and Nigeria. I am looking for UK data roles, such as data scientist, analyst, BI, and ML engineer. I
 bring a potent combination of technical skills (Python, SQL, ML, and Power BI), and I am open to relocation

I’ve worked with organizations in the **UK, Finland, and Nigeria**, delivering:
- 🧠 Predictive models for strategic planning  
- 📊 Dashboards for real-time monitoring  
- 🔄 Automated workflows that save time and money  

I'm currently looking for roles in **Data Science**, **Analytics**, **Business Intelligence**, or **ML Engineering** in the UK, but I’m open to relocation.

## Project 1: Unveiling the Darkness of Rape

### 🔍 Overview
This project explores patterns in sexual violence using police data from **Los Angeles (2020–2023)**. The goal is to identify insights that can assist **law enforcement, policy makers, and advocacy groups** in preventing rape and supporting survivors.

**🗂️ Dataset:** [Crime Data on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sanjanchaudhari/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)  
**📓 Notebook:** [View Analysis Notebook](./UNVEILING%20THE%20DARKNESS%20OF%20RAPE%20(1).ipynb)  
**📍 Location:** Los Angeles, California  
**📅 Timeframe Analyzed:** 2020–2023

### 🎯 Aim & Objectives

**Aim:**  
To uncover key insights from rape-related police reports, including trends in reporting delays, victim–perpetrator relationships, and case resolution outcomes.

**Objectives:**
- Determine how relationships with perpetrators affect reporting time and resolution.
- Analyze timing of incidents (day vs. night, weekend vs. weekday).
- Track year-by-year trends in case outcomes.
- Identify barriers to case resolution.

---

### 📊 Key Findings

- **Victim–Perpetrator Relationship:**  
  Most offenders were acquaintances. These cases were often unresolved, especially when reported late.

- **Incident Timing:**  
  Rape was more frequent on weekends and at night, suggesting social or relational proximity to perpetrators.

- **Resolution Trends:**  
  Over 90% of cases remained open year-to-year. Reporting delay was a major contributor to this.

- **Time Series Analysis:**  
  Crime patterns spike periodically suggesting certain days or seasons require more public safety focus.

---

### 👥 Stakeholder Impact

- **Law Enforcement:** Targeted patrols based on peak times and zones.
- **Policy Makers:** Improved laws around timely evidence collection and reporting procedures.
- **Social Workers/NGOs:** Survivor-centered programs and public education.
- **Researchers:** Foundation for building predictive crime-prevention models.
- **Public:** Awareness to encourage timely action and support systems.
